# Hello!

This is my first time ever creating a website completely from scratch. I first learned HTML/CSS a year ago, but never made my own project.
So I thought, why not make one for Potterheads? Of course I had a lot of help and inspiration from Youtube tutorials and Google, but the design and "programming"
was all me. Sorry if it's not great. I'm still learning!
